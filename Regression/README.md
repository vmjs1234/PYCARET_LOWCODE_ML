# Regression with PyCaret

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating regression using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python.


## Notebook Contents

The notebook in this directory covers:

- Setting up PyCaret for regression
- Loading and preprocessing a dataset (different from the official PyCaret examples)
- Training and comparing multiple regression models
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have PyCaret installed (`pip install pycaret`)
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in this directory
3. Run the cells sequentially

Note: The notebook is set up to use GPU if available (`use_gpu=True` in the setup function).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is [[Real estate house price regression](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quantbruce/real-estate-price-prediction)] from [Kaggle]. 

## Video Tutorial

A comprehensive video tutorial explaining this notebook and its outputs is available at [[VIDEO](https://drive.google.com/file/d/101XDd-nfYLidv50O6VlznBuAsBXiDnwC/view?usp=sharing)].

## Additional Notes

- This implementation uses full AutoML capabilities of PyCaret for regression.
- The code has been rewritten and is not a direct copy from PyCaret examples to ensure originality.
