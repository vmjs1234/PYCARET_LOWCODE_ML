# Association Rules Mining with PyCaret

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating association rules mining using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python.


## Notebook Contents

The notebook in this directory covers:

- Setting up PyCaret for association rules mining
- Loading and preprocessing a dataset (different from the official PyCaret examples)
- Applying association rules mining algorithms
- Analyzing and interpreting the results

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have PyCaret installed (`pip install pycaret==2.3.5`)
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in this directory
3. Run the cells sequentially

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is [[groceries dataset](https://kaggle.com/datasets/heeraldedhia/groceries-dataset)] from [Kaggle]. It was chosen to demonstrate association rules mining on [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATA].

## Video Tutorial

A comprehensive video tutorial explaining this notebook and its outputs is available at [LINK_TO_VIDEO].

## Additional Notes

- This implementation uses full AutoML capabilities of PyCaret for association rules mining.
- The code has been rewritten and is not a direct copy from PyCaret examples to ensure originality.
