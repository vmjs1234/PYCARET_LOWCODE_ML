# Anomaly Detection with PyCaret

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating anomaly detection using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python.


## Notebook Contents

The notebook in this directory covers:

- Setting up PyCaret for anomaly detection
- Loading and preprocessing a dataset (different from the official PyCaret examples)
- Applying various anomaly detection algorithms
- Analyzing and visualizing the results

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have PyCaret installed (`pip install pycaret`)
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in this directory
3. Run the cells sequentially

Note: The notebook is set up to use GPU if available (`use_gpu=True` in the setup function).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is [[Intrusion detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/what0919/intrusion-detection/data?select=test_data.csv)] from [Kaggle]. It was chosen to demonstrate anomaly detection

## Video Tutorial

A comprehensive video tutorial explaining this notebook and its outputs is available at [LINK_TO_VIDEO].

## Additional Notes

- This implementation uses full AutoML capabilities of PyCaret for anomaly detection.
- The code has been rewritten and is not a direct copy from PyCaret examples to ensure originality.
