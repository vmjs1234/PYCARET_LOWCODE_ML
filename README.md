# PyCaret Low-Code Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various machine learning tasks using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following subdirectories, each focusing on a specific machine learning task:

1. [Anomaly Detection](./Anomaly%20Detection)
2. [Association Rules Mining](./Association%20Rules%20Mining)
3. [Binary Classification](./Binary%20Classification)
4. [Clustering](./Clustering)
5. [Multiclass Classification](./Multiclass%20Classification)
6. [Regression](./Regression)
7. [Time Series With Exogenous Variable](./Time%20Series%20With%20Exogenous%20Variable)
8. [Time Series Without Exogenous Variable](./Time%20Series%20Without%20Exogenous%20Variable)

Each subdirectory contains:
- A Jupyter notebook implementing the specific machine learning task
- A README.md file explaining the contents and how to run the notebook


## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to each subdirectory to find the specific machine learning task you're interested in.
3. Follow the instructions in each subdirectory's README.md file to run the notebooks.

## Video Tutorials

Comprehensive video tutorials explaining each notebook and its outputs are available at [LINK_TO_VIDEO_PLAYLIST].

## Additional Notes

- All implementations use full AutoML capabilities of PyCaret for their respective tasks.
- The code has been rewritten and is not a direct copy from PyCaret examples to ensure originality.
- Datasets used in these notebooks are different from those in the official PyCaret examples.
- GPU acceleration is enabled where possible (`use_gpu=True` in the setup function).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyCaret (latest version)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

To install PyCaret, run:
```
pip install pycaret
```
