# Multiclass Classification with PyCaret

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating multiclass classification using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python.


## Notebook Contents

The notebook in this directory covers:

- Setting up PyCaret for multiclass classification
- Loading and preprocessing a dataset (different from the official PyCaret examples)
- Training and comparing multiple classification models
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have PyCaret installed (`pip install pycaret`)
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in this directory
3. Run the cells sequentially

Note: The notebook is set up to use GPU if available (`use_gpu=True` in the setup function).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is [[Cirrhosis multi class classification stage 1,2,3,4](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/cirrhosis-prediction-dataset/data)] from [Kaggle]. It was chosen to demonstrate multiclass classification on [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATA].

## Video Tutorial

A comprehensive video tutorial explaining this notebook and its outputs is available at [LINK_TO_VIDEO].

## Additional Notes

- This implementation uses full AutoML capabilities of PyCaret for multiclass classification.
- The code has been rewritten and is not a direct copy from PyCaret examples to ensure originality.
