# Clustering with PyCaret

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook demonstrating clustering using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python.


## Notebook Contents

The notebook in this directory covers:

- Setting up PyCaret for clustering
- Loading and preprocessing a dataset (different from the official PyCaret examples)
- Applying various clustering algorithms
- Analyzing and visualizing cluster results

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have PyCaret installed (`pip install pycaret`)
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in this directory
3. Run the cells sequentially

Note: The notebook is set up to use GPU if available (`use_gpu=True` in the setup function).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is [[UN Country index dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vittoriogiatti/unsdg-united-nations-sustainable-development-group)] from [Kaggle]. It was chosen to demonstrate clustering on [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATA].

## Video Tutorial

A comprehensive video tutorial explaining this notebook and its outputs is available at [LINK_TO_VIDEO].

## Additional Notes

- This implementation uses full AutoML capabilities of PyCaret for clustering.
- The code has been rewritten and is not a direct copy from PyCaret examples to ensure originality.
